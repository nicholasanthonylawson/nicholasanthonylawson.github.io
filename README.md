I currently gave myself an A+ in social media website design for a small academic breakthrough in creating a bridge between github's permanent fixture web hosting platform for projects and then i linked to another permanent location on google's document platform and i used a share link with everyone can edit turned on and now i have a nice little URL that I can put on a business card and walk around downtown and promote hand to hand style and the URL is as it is at the top and that's a slight improvement to google doc's extended unwieldly URL that you get ... i can't put a google doc share link on a business card but i can with an HTML redirect get the URL I need from github and the google document i need from google and I now have a poppin little prototype for what ideally i would want to program 2 years from now with further javascript studies or i could just pass off this concept to you in working prototype form and let you know that i think in terms of clubs this document that i am sharing with you here works better than reddit and the only change i would make would be to add bureaucracy to the delete function i want it so that someone can come in and delete everything but i also don't want to destroy writing but this is amazing to me i gave myself an A+ ... this is brandery quality work at an advanced user level ... this is something to look at ... this is something that when it's poppin people can come in and place culture and advertisement and if everyone knows someone is out there hustling business cards that keeps it poppin ... 

i'm working on being brandery quality in my programming studies of html css and javascript and javascript is something that i just got comfortable with and i need portfolio work now and that didn't stop me from achieving my dream something i thought of once but finally put into practice today ...

this is a novel little academic footnote .... http://nicholasanthonylawson.github.io it's the part where i hustle the website with business cards that creates the club like atmosphere ... 

i thought i would share my advanced user breakthrough ... i am quite proud of myself ... it's a great prototype if you have some crack engineers that can create a stand alone version of this ... this is something for clifton and the arts district this is for people that participate in social media this is the next social media platform ... if writing turns you off clearly this is not for you .... but if you participate in social media and know it's mostly about giving and commenting this is for you ... this is what reddit isnt ... it's something that google developed that i start marketing in the spring ... 

be weird if i was the person that made google document's cool in cincinnati ...i heard there are students that are using it for note taking on chrome books ... i'm using it for how cool it is ... 

sincerely,

nicholas lawson

not sure why i would enter your program or apply but that doesn't mean i can't share my work with you

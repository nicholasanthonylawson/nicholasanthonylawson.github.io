START
</p>

<p>
Dick was involved in his own personal downward dog in the middle of his apartment. He knew he had too much stuff. Just too much. He knew he did. He knew it. He didn’t even want carpeting. He knew he wanted a wood floor. He knew he did. He knew it. He knew when it came to floor he wanted wood. He knew it. When it came to wood floors he knew he wanted wood. He was in the downward dog position and he was just at the point where he was transitioning to the upward dog position when she walked in.
</p>

<p>
“Cha doin?” said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“Yoga.” Said Dick.
</p>

<p>
“K’s” said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t even do yoga when you are in the room even though I would love to be able to.” Said Dick.
</p>

<p>
“Y Not?” said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“I’m not at that level yet. I’m not at the level where I can do yoga in my apartment with someone else in the room. I’m not. I can do yoga in a room with an instructor but I’m not at the level of my yoga where when someone else is in the room I can keep doing yoga. I can do yoga by myself alone and that’s the only way I can really do yoga.” Said Dick.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t have to do yoga.” Said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“I know. Well I sort of have to. I know I don’t have to. Like I know. But I sort of do.” Said Dick.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t do yoga.” Said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“Aaagh. I know. You don’t do a lot of stuff.” Said Dick.
</p>

<p>
“Is there anything wrong with not doing a lot of stuff?” said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“No.” said Dick the opposite of sternly but just as confident. A very confident not stern statement of just that.
</p>

<p>
“Can you get in trouble for doing a lot of stuff?” said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“Yeah. If I am being honest. If you do a lot of stuff you can get in trouble.” Said Dick.
</p>

<p>
“I know. I know that a long time ago.” Said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“Well.” Said Dick.
</p>

<p>
Ze shook her head a little bit from side to side and it looked like she had the first thought she had had in several times and she sort of bended her neck and her head moved from side to side and she rolled her head around some and she sort of looked to the side and then she looked at Dick and then she lowered her body and did a single push up.
</p>

<p>
“If you did one of those a day. You would do 365 a year. That’s not a small number.” Said Ze.
</p>

<p>
Dick’s eyes sort of reacted and that was all.
<p>

</p>

<p>
STARTING
</p>

<p>
Ze had her chiffon on. She was standing there looking in the mirror. She was just looking at herself. She was sort of noticing how she liked the color of the chiffon. It was the only dress she was ever given and she only wore it in front of the mirror. No one else knew that.
</p>

<p>
Dick walked in and noticed her wearing the chiffon in front of the mirror and when she realized someone saw her wearing it. She habitually stopped looking in the mirror and started to pull her shoulder out of the dress and she started to disrobe. Dick sort of noticed her taking the dress off and he sort of pulled his head to the side and looked at her through the sides of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
She looked over her shoulder at him.
</p>

<p>
She wasn’t going to get naked but she knew he was going to see some skin.
</p>

<p>
Dick sort of stood there and watched her.
</p>

<p>
She knew she was trapped in that the closet she needed to get her clothing from was in the closet behind Dick and that she needed to ask him to move to get some clothing.
</p>

<p>
She wasn’t happy today.
</p>

<p>
Dick wasn’t happy either.
</p>

<p>
She walked over to the closet with the chiffon folded over onto itself and her bra was exposed and she brushed Dick aside for a moment without touching him and she went through her closet and decided that out of the fourteen outfits she had that she was going to wear a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. She picked the most rock t-shirt that she could find and the jeans she treated as a project once with a knife. She knows exactly why she treats all of her jeans with a knife.
</p>

<p>
Dick saw her going at a pair of jeans once with a knife and he didn’t want to know why. She just this one time she was all with knife and she was like the jeans bent her or something and she just went in on em.
</p>

<p>
Dick saw her pull the jeans from the closet and she pulled her “1 Fuck Given and Only 1” T Shirt and she just knew she was going to go for a walk. She thought for a second that she felt a certain way when she went for a walk for no reason and cars were passing her on the side and she just it depended on what she was wearing but from time to time it occurred to her that she could at any time but to this day she is sort of proud she never did.
</p>

<p>
Dick sort of didn’t know about that and he never asked her about most of what she was surprised no one ever asked her about and she really only talked about what she was asked about.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
START
</p>

<p>
Dick went into the bathroom and picked up his tooth brush and picked up some toothpaste and he did this. He put the tooth paste on his finger and put his finger to his teeth and put some toothpaste on his teeth. He kept his brush clean and shook his shoulders and went. Different.
</p>

<p>
Ze saw him do it.
</p>

<p>
She had this moment.
</p>

<p>
“Dick!” said Ze.
</p>

<p>
“What?” said Dick knowing da fuck she was talking about.
</p>

<p>
“The right way?!” said Ze with her head forward and lowered and to the side with a look on her face like you know god damned good and well how to brush your teeth.
</p>

<p>
Dick looked at her and didn’t say anything and just put some toothpaste on his tooth brush.
</p>
